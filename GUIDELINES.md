# Guidelines

Strongly inspired by https://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/


### When to write

When a topic becomes to complicated or complex to be guessed by this documentation's readers, or to improve its current state.


### Separate the concerns

It is convenient to distinct 4 tones to adopt regarding the documentation chapter.

* **Contextualization**: Express why you write this documentation, in which context and for who.    
This is mainly the purpose of the introduction.

* **Step-by-step tutorial**: Quick and clear tutorial with cross-references to further in-depth explanations. It should have small steps and frequent "wins" (~every 30 mins) in order to keep the reader in a focus state. It should be easy to follow for the most, but beginners without enough knowledges should fail quickly.    
This is mainly the purpose of "Getting started".

* **In-depth documentation**: Complete explanations of a specific subject or a group of subjects. It should include the range and the goals.    
This is mainly the purpose of "Going further".

* **Reference**: an API or a command-line manual. Examples are welcome.    
This is mainly the purpose of "References".


### Style

Although it is not easy to choose a writing style, there are some practices that we (are trying to) follow:

* We - at Cozy - take pleasure to develop and extend Cozy every day, and it should be felt by the reader.    
**Be enjoyed**.

* Adopt a personal tone between you and the reader. Use "you" and the future tense.    
**Be conversational**.

* Don't be afraid to use verb first, to write small sentences and paragraphs, to concatenate ("do not" => "don't"), and to remove unecessary adjectives ("<s>pretty</s>", "<s>mostly</s>", "<s>good</s>", etc.).    
**Be concise, forceful and clear**.

* Use structural elements liberally: **emphasis**, lists, notice blocks, images, tables, etc.    
**Be graphical**.

* Find someone to read you before publishing, to avoid writing tics.    
**Be less French**. :-)
