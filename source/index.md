Welcome to the **Cozy Developer Space**.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="images/cozy-logo-gradient.png" style="max-width: 150px"></p>

Here you’ll find everything you need to understand Cozy technically and to develop applications and konnectors.

The **technical level required** to read and understand this documentation is not over 9,000; you’ll roughly have to:

 * Understand how the web works (both **client** and **server** side)
 * Read/Write **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**
 * Install and run a **Node.js** process
 * Be comfortable with **command-line** calls
 * Know that cookie are not made of flour

 > Code examples are available in **both JavaScript and CoffeeScript** for <s>every troll's taste</s> everyone's preference.

```javascript
console.log(" ╰(◕‿◕)╯ ");
```
```coffeescript
console.log " ╰(◕‿◕)╯ "
```

## Why & How we made Cozy

![Capture 1](images/capture-1.jpg)

Cozy is a **personal web deployment platform**, which enables you to quickly bootstrap applications and interact with your data. It stands on a server - between your application and the operating system - easying the pain of **system administration**, **web development** and **security**.

### Data-oriented (WIP)

The initial idea was to create a space where developers can **experiment and play with their data**, while remaining in control of the platform. A friendly centralized point to fetch data from Things-Of-Internet, devices and personal services.

More than a simple Platform-as-a-Service, Cozy puts the cloud back where it belongs: at home.

### Tools

Cozy also became our **daily working environment**, and we want it to be as comfortable as possible. It means that we require it flexible, extensible and usable. We use **Node.js** and **CouchDB** as our main technologies.

</p>


**Node.js** is a great and modern engine with a huge community of module creators. It has elvoved along with the GitHub's Open-Source popularization and is now wide-spread in the Web industry. Aside from being heavily maintained, it remains fun to extend and play with.

</p>

**CouchDB** is surely less-known, but definetly reliable. As a proper Erlang program, it has proven its strength and stability. A consistent, well-documented API, plus wonderful replication capabilities: the recipe of what we love on a database engine.    



## Developing with Cozy

Definitely real testimonials from definitely real individuals:

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;"></p>

“ *Cozy has been a great opportunity for me to start coding. Now I run a decent business.* ”     
<small>Bill Getas - Startup entrepreneur</small>

“ *Thanks to Cozy, I successfully managed to build a working web application without a hassle.* ”     
<small>Tim Bernee-Lers - enthusiast web developer</small>

“ *I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.* ”     
<small>HAL 9000 - CoffeeScript compiler</small>

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;"></p>

But to be honest, we don't need those fancy words to convince you to develop on Cozy.


### To the future, Marty!

Cozy is a **modern web platform** that abstracts a lot of complexity out of personal **data manipulation**. If you are planning on developing a tool to **fetch**, **visualize** or **mix data**, a Cozy Application or a Konnector may be a good way to start.

By developing on Cozy, you will:

 * Reach a community of **enthusiast testers** and end-users
 * Learn how to make **single-page applications** with modern JavaScript frameworks like **Angular.js** or **React.js**
 * Be guided by [Cozy mentors](#mentorship), JavaScript gurus and other contributors
 * Enjoy the **built-in security** of Cozy

And whatever the reason, you will always find a friendly team member to help you dealing with your struggles and questions on the [IRC channel](#irc).

**So let's dive into it**!
